A bus organization consists of 7 CPU registers. The output of each register is connected to two multiplexers to form the two buses A and B. The selection lines in each multiplexer select one register or the input data for the particular bus. The A and B buses form the inputs to a common arithmetic logic unit(ALU). The operation selected in the ALU determines the arithmetic or logic micro operation that is performed. The register set with common ALU block diagram is shown below
