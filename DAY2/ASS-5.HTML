	A bus organization consists of 7 CPU registers. 	
	The output of each register is connected to two multiplexers to form the two buses A and B.
	 The selection lines in each multiplexer select one register or the input data for the particular bus. 
	The A and B buses form the inputs to a common arithmetic logic unit(ALU). The operation selected in the ALU determines the arithmetic or logic micro operation that is performed.
	 The register set with common ALU block diagram is shown below 
	The four control selection variables are generated in the control unit and must be available 
	at the beginning of a clock cycle.  The data from the 2 source registers propagate through	
	 the gates in the multiplexers and the ALU, to the output bus, and into the inputs of the destination register, all during the clock cycle interval.  Next clock cycle produces output to register R1 from below example.
